								<p>An audience-pleasing riff on the dirty underbelly of the American Idol phenomenon, GREAT WORLD OF SOUND stars Patrick Healy and Kene Holliday as Martin and Clarence, two normal southern guys who get caught up in the excitement of a record industry talent scouting scheme.  Unemployed one day and record producers the next, Martin and Clarence have a blast signing new acts and hit the road looking for the next big thing.  But what happens once the checks are cashed? Craig Zobels independent film bona fides are firmly in place: he served on the crew of David Gordon Greens early films, and Green serves as executive producer of GREAT WORLD OF SOUND.  But it may be more helpful to go into GREAT WORLD OF SOUND knowing that Zobel has recently made a living between films by working on reality TV shows like The Apprentice. I became fascinated by how desperate people were to get on TV, but how little they seemed to care about how they were portrayed once they got there, he says</p>

								<p>Coach Fields (David Koechner) is pathetic.  He has the distinction of being the worst coach in the history of sports anyone can recall.  A loser of enormous proportions, the incompetent and seemingly hopeless coach is convinced by fellow coach Freddie Wiseman (Carl Weathers) to return to the field for one last shot.  Assuring his long suffering wife (Melora Hardin) that he will not ignore his family, Coach moves them to Plainfolk, Texas where he hopes to redeem himself and his reputation.</p>

								<p>The new thriller reteaming acclaimed director David Cronenberg with his A History of Violence leading man Viggo Mortensen, Eastern Promises is written by Steve Knight (Academy Award-nominated screenwriter of Dirty Pretty Things).  As in the earlier film, director and star together explore the psyche, physicality, and fortunes of a man whose true nature may never be wholly revealed.  The mysterious and charismatic Russian-born Nikolai Luzhin (Mr. Mortensen) is a driver for one of London’s most notorious organized crime families of Eastern European origin. The family itself is part of the Vory V Zakone criminal brotherhood. Headed by Semyon (Academy Award nominee Armin Mueller-Stahl), whose courtly charm as the welcoming proprietor of the plush Trans-Siberian restaurant impeccably masks a cold and brutal core, the family’s fortunes are tested by Semyon’s volatile son and enforcer, Kirill (Vincent Cassel), who is more tightly bound to Nikolai than to his own father.  But Nikolai’s carefully maintained existence is jarred once he crosses paths at Christmastime with Anna Khitrova (Academy Award nominee Naomi Watts), a midwife at a North London hospital. Anna is deeply affected by the desperate situation of a young teenager who dies while giving birth to a baby. Anna resolves to try to trace the baby’s lineage and relatives. The girl’s personal diary also survives her; it is written in Russian, and Anna seeks answers in it.  Anna’s mother Helen (Sinéad Cusack) does not discourage her, but Anna’s irascible Russian-born uncle Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski) urges caution. He is right to do so; by delving into the diary, Anna has accidentally unleashed the full fury of the Vory.  With Semyon and Kirill closing ranks and Anna pressing her inquiries, Nikolai unexpectedly finds his loyalties divided. The family tightens its grip on him; who can, or should, he trust? Several lives - including his own - hang in the balance as a harrowing chain of murder, deceit, and retribution reverberates through the darkest corners of both the family and London itself.</p>

								<p>Ryan, Wade and Emmit attend their first day at high school and they’re pumped ... until they meet up with Filkins, a school bully who comes off like a little Hannibal Lecter. Before they become completely engulfed in Filkins’ reign of terror, they seek out some protection by placing an ad in soldier of fortune magazine. Their best response - and the cheapest - comes from Drillbit Taylor (Owen Wilson), a down-on-his luck soldier of fortune who lives a homeless - he likes to say “home free” - existence on the beach. He enrolls them in some physical and mental training.</p>

								<p>On a warm September evening, college professor Ethan Learner (Joaquin Phoenix), his wife Grace (Jennifer Connelly), and their daughter Emma (Elle Fanning) are attending a recital. Their 10-year-old son Josh (Sean Curley) is playing cello — beautifully, as usual. His younger sister looks up to him, and his parents are proud of their son. On the way home, they all stop at a gas station on Reservation Road. There, in one terrible instant, he is taken from them forever. On a warm September evening, law associate Dwight Arno (Mark Ruffalo) and his 11-year-old son Lucas (Eddie Alderson) are attending a baseball game. Their favorite team, the Red Sox, is playing - and, hopefully, heading for the World Series. Dwight cherishes his time spent with Lucas. Driving his son back to his ex-wife, Lucas’ mother Ruth Wheldon (Mira Sorvino), Dwight heads towards his fateful encounter at Reservation Road. The accident happens so fast that Lucas is all but unaware, while Ethan — the only witness — is all too aware, as a panicked Dwight speeds away. The police are called, and an investigation begins. Haunted by the tragedy, both fathers react in unexpected ways, as do Grace and Emma. As a reckoning looms, the two fathers are forced to make the hardest choices of their lives.</p>

								<p>TV News reporter Simon Hunt (Richard Gere) and cameraman Duck (Terrence Howard have worked in the world’s hottest war zones: from Bosnia to Iraq, from Somalia to El Salvador. Together they have dodged bullets, filed incisive reports and collected Emmy awards. Then one terrible day in a Bosnian village everything changes. During a live broadcast on national television, Simon has a meltdown. After that, Duck is promoted and Simon just disappears. Five years later Duck returns to Sarajevo with rookie reporter Benjamin (Jessie Eisenberg) to cover the fifth anniversary of the end of the war. Simon shows up, a ghost from the past, with the promise of a world exclusive. He convinces Duck that he knows the whereabouts of Bosnias most wanted war criminal The Fox. Armed with only spurious information Simon, Duck and Benjamin embark on a dark and dangerous mission that takes them deep into hostile territory.</p>

								<p>The story of three quirky families seeking to buy their next home. They’re all moving for different reasons-and none of them are getting along with their real estate agents. African American attorneys Bobby and Tamika have hired Hillary Macella as their real estate agent.  Hillary is a racially hyper-sensitive white woman dealing with more than her share of white guilt.  That is until she gets mugged, and starts seeing the world quite a bit differently. Tom and Dawn are an unconventional couple. When they met, Tom was happily married to another woman. But thanks to Dawn’s unstoppable persistence (the police reports called it stalking, but Dawn doesn’t like to think of it that way), Tom was convinced to leave his wife and start his life over again in a new home with Dawn. They’ve wound up with a shady real estate agent with a knack for damaging homes to make them more affordable for his clients. This makes house hunting somewhat awkward for Tom and Dawn, not to mention a little dangerous.</p>

								<p>Its New Years Eve in the city of Terminus and chaos is this years resolution. All forms of communication have been jammed by an enigmatic transmission that preys on fear and desire driving everyone in the city to murder and madness. In a place once marked by conformity but now sent into complete anarchy, the rebellious Ben must save the woman he loves from the bedlam in the streets as well as her crazed sadistic husband. But the only way he can tell who to trust or who has given in to violence is by uncovering the true nature of The Signal.</p>

								<p>A full-throttle, martial arts thriller, Lionsgate’s WAR stars Jet Li (FEARLESS, UNLEASHED, THE ONE) and Jason Statham (CRANK, THE ITALIAN JOB) as two adversaries set on a violent collision course in the Asian mob underground. Produced by Steven Chasman, Jim Thompson and Christopher Petzel, WAR is directed by Philip G. Atwell from a script by Lee Anthony Smith and Gregory J. Bradley. After his partner is brutally murdered by the infamous assassin Rogue (Jet Li), FBI agent Jack Crawford (Jason Statham) vows to find the elusive killer and personally avenge his partner’s death. But Rogue proves untraceable until three years later when he resurfaces to ignite a bloody turf war between Chinese mob leader Chang (John Lone) and Japanese Yakuza boss Shiro (Ryo Ishibashi). Eager to capture Rogue once and for all, Crawford leads his team of crime specialists headlong into the conflict. But Crawford’s thirst for vengeance jeopardizes his professional judgment, and as the violence escalates, Crawford finally comes face to face with his enemy to discover that nothing about Rogue or his plan is quite what it seems.</p>

								<p>From acclaimed musician and filmmaker Rob Zombie (The Devil’s Rejects, House of 1000 Corpses) comes an entirely new take on the highly successful film and terrifying Halloween legacy that began in 1978.  While revealing a new chapter in the established Michael Myers saga, the film will surprise both classic and modern horror fans with a departure from prior films in the Halloween franchise.  Audiences should brace themselves for unprecendented fear as Zombie turns back time to uncover the making of a pathologically disturbed, even cursed child named Michael Myers.</p>

								<p>A new CG animated feature film from 20th Century Fox Animation, the makers of the “Ice Age” films, based on the beloved book, first published in 1954, by Ted Geisel, who wrote under the pen name Dr. Seuss.  Seuss books are among the defining works of family literature, have sold over 200 million copies, and have been translated into fifteen languages.  The “Horton” series (“Horton Hears a Who,” “Horton Hatches the Egg”) are consistently among the top-selling of all Seuss titles — generation after generation. HORTON HEARS A WHO is about an imaginative elephant who hears a cry for help coming from a tiny speck of dust floating through the air. Suspecting there may be life on that speck and despite a surrounding community which thinks he has lost his mind, Horton is determined to help.</p>

								<p>The Last Legion” is a fantasy action-adventure in the vein of “The Sword and the Stone” set against the fall of Rome and its last emperor, 12 year-old Romulus Augustus, the boy who would rule for a day before losing all that he loved: his family, his home, and an empire that once stood for truth and honor.  Imprisoned on the island-fortress of Capri, Romulus searches for a means of escape.  He discovers instead “excaliburnus,” the legendary sword of Julius Caesar, and realizes that he must do all in his power to save Rome.  Aided by the clever strategies of his teacher, Ambrosinus, and the heroic skills of his loyal legionnaire, Aurelius, Romulus escapes the island.  Accompanied by his friends and a mysterious envoy from Constantinople, Romulus travels to Britannia in search of the last Roman Legion - the fabled Dragon Legion.  There, Romulus will fight alongside his friends to make his last stand for Rome and take his first steps to becoming a man and the king who would father a legend.</p>

								<p>Michael Clayton (GEORGE CLOONEY) is an in-house fixer at one of the largest corporate law firms in New York.  A former criminal prosecutor, Clayton takes care of Kenner, Bach & Ledeens dirtiest work at the behest of the firms co-founder Marty Bach (SYDNEY POLLACK).  Though burned out and hardly content with his job as a fixer, his divorce, a failed business venture and mounting debt have left Clayton inextricably tied to the firm. At U/North, meanwhile, the career of litigator Karen Crowder (TILDA SWINTON) rests on the multi-million dollar settlement of a class action suit that Claytons firm is leading to a seemingly successful conclusion.  But when Kenner Bachs brilliant and guilt-ridden attorney Arthur Edens (TOM WILKINSON) sabotages the U/North case, Clayton faces the biggest challenge of his career and his life</p>

								<p>On the outskirts of Las Vegas, far from the bright lights of the Strip, 17 year-old Andrews life is spiraling out of control.  Powerless to intervene as he backslides into drugs, alcohol, and violence, his mother decides to hire a private company to forcibly kidnap Andrew and take him to a locked-down (and corrupt) psychiatric center for teens.  As Andrew is subjected to the physical and emotional abuses of the program, something inside of him is re-awakened, and he decides the only way to get back on track is to face his demons head-on.</p>

								<p>A sweet, hilarious and slightly subversive romantic comedy that examines the issues of marriage, monogamy and whether “I do” is the only path to life-long love and happiness. Ira Black is brilliant, neurotic, Jewish and has so many issues he can’t fit them into 12 years of analysis. Abby Willoughby is a free spirit who works in a gym and is better at solving her friends’ problems than selling memberships. When the two meet, the impossible happens: they fall in love, meet each other’s parents and decide to get married, all in a few breathless hours. And life is good, for a while, until a series of comic misadventures (multiple divorces, in-laws, affairs, exes, and too many therapists) force the couple to rethink their strategies.</p>

								<p>In the span of only a few months, 4-year-old Marla Olmstead rocketed from total obscurity into international renown  and sold over $300,000 dollars worth of paintings.  She was compared to Kandinsky and Pollock, and called a budding Picasso.  Inside Edition, The Jane Pauley Show, and NPR did pieces, and The Today Show and Good Morning America got in a bidding war over an appearance by the bashful toddler.  There was talk of corporate sponsorship with the family fielding calls from The Gap and Crayola. But not all of the attention was positive.  From the beginning, many faulted her parents for exposing Marla to the glare of the media and accused the couple of exploiting their daughter for financial gain. Others felt her work was, in fact, comparable to the great abstract expressionists  but saw this as emblematic of the meaninglessness of Modern Art.  She is painting exactly as all the adult paintings have been in the past 50 years, but painting like a child, too.  That is what everybody thinks but they dont dare to say it, said Oggi, the leading Italian weekly.  Through no intention of her own, Marla revived the age-old question, what is art?</p>

								<p>Written by Six Feet Under scribe Nancy Oliver, Lars and the Real Girl is a heartfelt comedy starring Academy-Award nominated Ryan Gosling as Lars Lindstrom a loveable introvert whose emotional baggage has kept him from fully embracing life. After years of what is almost solitude, he invites Bianca, a friend he met on the internet to visit him. He introduces Bianca to his Brother Gus (Paul Schneider) and his wife Karen (Emily Mortimer) and they are stunned. They don’t know what to say to Lars or Bianca — because she is a life-size doll, not a real person and he is treating her as though she is alive. They consult the family doctor Dagmar (Patricia Clarkson) who explains this is a delusion he’s created — for what reason she doesn’t yet know but they should all go along with it. What follows is an emotional journey for Lars and the people around him.</p>

								<p>In a time of heroes, the mighty warrior Beowulf slays the demon Grendel and incurs the wrath of its monstrous yet seductive mother in a conflict that transforms a king into a legend. Groundbreaking director Robert Zemeckis offers a vision of the Beowulf saga that has never been told before “Beowulf,” starring Ray Winstone in the title role and Anthony Hopkins as the corrupt King Hrothgar, as well as John Malkovich, Robin Wright Penn, Brendan Gleeson, Crispin Glover, Alison Lohman, and Angelina Jolie as Grendel’s mother. Neil Gaiman (“Mirrormask, the graphic novel,” “Sandman”) & Roger Avary (“Pulp Fiction”) adapted the legend for the screen.</p>

								<p>The first film of its kind to chronicle the reasons behind Iraq’s descent into guerilla war, warlord rule, criminality and anarchy, NO END IN SIGHT is a jaw-dropping, insider’s tale of wholesale incompetence, recklessness and venality. Based on over 200 hours of footage, the film provides a candid retelling of the events following the fall of Baghdad in 2003 by high ranking officials such as former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, Ambassador Barbara Bodine (in charge of Baghdad during the Spring of 2003), Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, former Chief of Staff to Colin Powell, and General Jay Garner (in charge of the occupation of Iraq through May 2003), as well as Iraqi civilians, American soldiers and prominent analysts. NO END IN SIGHT examines the manner in which the principal errors of U.S. policy - the use of insufficient troop levels, allowing the looting of Baghdad, the purging of professionals from the Iraqi government and the disbanding of the Iraqi military - largely created the insurgency and chaos that engulf Iraq today.</p>

								<p>Based on the acclaimed novel by Pulitzer Prize winning American master Cormac McCarthy. The time is our own, when rustlers have given way to drug- runners and small towns have become free-fire zones. The story begins when Llewelyn Moss (BROLIN) finds a pickup truck surrounded by a sentry of dead men. A load of heroin and two million dollars in cash are still in the back. When Moss takes the money, he sets off a chain reaction of catastrophic violence that not even the law - in the person of aging, disillusioned Sheriff Bell (JONES) - can contain. As Moss tries to evade his pursuers - in particular a mysterious mastermind who flips coins for human lives (BARDEM) - the film simultaneously strips down the American crime drama and broadens its concerns to encompass themes as ancient as the Bible and as bloodily contemporary as this morning’s headlines.</p>

								<p>Stars Russell Crowe, Christian Bale, Ben Foster, Gretchen Mol and Peter Fonda in a modern take on the classic western by Elmore Leonard from producing/writing/ directing team Cathy Konrad and James Mangold (WALK THE LINE). In Arizona in the late 1800’s, infamous outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe) and his vicious gang of thieves and murderers have plagued the Southern Railroad. When Wade is captured, Civil War veteran Dan Evans (Christian Bale), struggling to survive on his drought-plagued ranch, volunteers to deliver him alive to the “3:10 to Yuma”, a train that will take the killer to trial. On the trail, Evans and Wade, each from very different worlds, begin to earn each other’s respect. But with Wade’s outfit on their trail - and dangers at every turn - the mission soon becomes a violent, impossible journey toward each man’s destiny.</p>

								<p>A supernatural, action packed movie with high-grade special effects and the kind of raw action scenes the world is coming to expect from Thailand. Set in rural Thailand during the 1920s Dan Chupong (Born To Fight) plays Jone Bang Fai a young man riddled with grief and bent on revenge after witnessing his parents’ murder by a callous and malicious killer. The only information Jone has as to the killer’s identity is the memory of a tattoo-covered man who is part of an organized group of cattle rustlers. Jone makes it his mission to stop all cattle rustlers and in the process return each head of cattle back to its rightful owner. After searching the country high and low, Jone finally believes he has found the murderer in a small rural village in the North of Thailand.  To Jone’s dismay he learns that the killer is in fact a warlock of immense power, a nearly invincible mystical man who is trying to control the whole village. His one weakness?  He can be harmed only by weapons that have been treated with the menstrual blood of a young virgin. Armed with this knowledge and a few hundred highly charged rockets (and a dash of menstrual blood), our intrepid hero goes up against one of the most dangerous men to have ever walked the Earth.</p>

								<p>From venerable Academy Award(r) winning director Robert Benton (KRAMER VS. KRAMER), comes a kaleidoscopic ode to life and love in all its funny, sad, sexy, crazy, heartbreaking and life sustaining facets: FEAST OF LOVE.  In a coffee shop in a tight-knit Oregon community, local professor Harry Stevenson (Academy Award(r) winner Morgan Freeman) witnesses love and attraction whipping up mischief among the town’s residents.  From the unlucky in love, die-hard romantic coffee shop owner Bradley (Academy Award(r) nominee Greg Kinnear) who has a serial habit of looking for love in all the wrong places, including with his current wife Kathryn (Selma Blair); to the edgy real estate agent Diana (Radha Mitchell) who is caught up in an affair with a married man (Billy Burke) with whom she shares an ineffable connection; to the beautiful young newcomer Chloe (Alexa Davalos) who defies fate in romancing the troubled Oscar (Toby Hemingway); to Harry himself, whose adoring wife (Jane Alexander) is looking to break through his wall of grief after the wrenching loss of a beloved . . .  they all intertwine into one remarkable story in which no one can escape being bent, broken, befuddled, delighted and ultimately redeemed by love’s inescapable spell.</p>

								<p>Tells the story of rugged superstar quarterback Joe Kingman (DWAYNE “THE ROCK” JOHNSON), whose Boston-based team is chasing a championship. A ‘serial bachelor’, Kingman is living the ultimate fantasy: he’s rich, famous and the life of the party. But this dream is suddenly sacked for a loss when he discovers the 7-year-old daughter (newcomer MADISON PETTIS) he never knew he had - the product of a last fling before parting years ago with his young wife. Now, during the most important time in his career, he must figure out how to juggle his parties, practices and dates with the newfound ballet classes, bedtime stories and dolls that come with his daughter. Equally perplexed is his hard-edged mega-agent, Stella (KYRA SEDGWICK), herself without a parental bone in her body. Despite the often hilarious misadventures that come with being a new father, Joe discovers that’s there’s more to life than money, endorsements and thousands of adoring fans: the love and care of one very special small fan is the only thing that matters.</p>

								<p>Between 1968 and 1972, nine American spacecraft voyaged to the Moon, and 12 men walked upon its surface. IN THE SHADOW OF THE MOON brings together for the first, and possibly the last, time surviving crew members from every single Apollo mission that flew to the Moon along with visually stunning archival material re-mastered from the original NASA film footage. The result is an intimate epic that vividly communicates the daring, the danger, the pride, and the promise of this extraordinary era in history when the whole world literally looked up at America.</p>

								<p>A teenager tackles the mysteries of life, love and public speaking in Rocket Science, a wry comedy of adolescent angst by Jeffrey Blitz, director of the Academy Award-nominated documentary Spellbound. Making his feature narrative debut, Blitz leaves behind the conventions and cliches of coming-of-age tales to instead conjure a world where everyone, regardless of age, is befuddled by desire and the longing for human connection. Mixing humor with a compassionate regard for his characters and their idiosyncrasies, Blitz creates a film about the little insights that can emerge from, and ultimately eclipse, the agonies and disappointments of youth.</p>

								<p>Among the classic high-school rebels of American movies, there have been truants, delinquents, pranksters and con artists  but there has never been anyone quite like Charlie Bartlett.  An optimist, a truth-teller and a fearless schemer, when Charlie slyly positions himself as his new schools resident psychiatrist, dishing out both honest advice and powerful prescriptions, he has no idea the ways in which he will transform his classmates, the school principal and the potential of his own life.</p>

								<p>In the all-new action comedy Get Smart, Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell) is on a mission to thwart the latest plot for world domination by the evil crime syndicate known as KAOS. When the headquarters of U.S. spy agency Control is attacked and the identities of its agents compromised, the Chief (Alan Arkin) has no choice but to promote his ever-eager analyst Maxwell Smart, who has always dreamt of working in the field alongside stalwart superstar Agent 23 (Dwayne The Rock Johnson). Smart is partnered instead with the only other agent whose identity has not been compromised: the lovely-but-lethal veteran Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway).  As Smart and 99 get closer to unraveling KAOS master planand each otherthey discover that key KAOS operative Siegfried (Terence Stamp) and his sidekick Shtarker (Kenneth Davitian) are scheming to cash in with their network of terror. Given little field experience and even less time, Smartarmed with nothing but a few spy-tech gadgets and his unbridled enthusiasmmust defeat KAOS if he is to save the day.</p>

								<p>An epic portrait of a family and a culture torn apart by poverty and violence, Ghosts of Cite Soleil is a powerful and unsettling documentary that takes us inside the lives of the notorious gang leaders who dominate the Haitian slum of Cite Soleil, one of the most desperate communities in the Western hemisphere.  Set to a score by Wyclef Jean, who also executive produced the film and serves as an inspiration to the young men of Haiti, the film follows two of the gang leaders, who happen to be brothers, and are also aspiring rappers.  The foot soldiers of these gang leaders are known as chimeres (or “ghosts”) and it was those ghosts whom former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is said to have employed to silence his opponents. Filmed in the months leading up to Aristide’s overthrow in 2004, the film captures the smoldering tensions between the two rival gang leaders, and their love for the same woman, set in a city the United Nations has declared the most dangerous place on Earth.</p>

								<p>Gone Baby Gone is Ben Afflecks directorial debut and is based on the novel from the acclaimed author of Mystic River.  It is an intense look inside an ongoing investigation about the mysterious disappearance of a little girl.

The film also stars Academy Award Winner Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby) and Academy Award Nominee Ed Harris (Pollack).</p>
